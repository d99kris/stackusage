.SH DESCRIPTION
stackusage runs an application and measures the stack usage of its
main thread and child threads. By helping determine stack
utilization, it enables adjusting stack sizes with desired margin.
The tool is particularly useful for applications and libraries
designed to work in resource\-constrained environments, such as
embedded systems.
